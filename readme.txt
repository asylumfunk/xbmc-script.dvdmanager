The Story:
=================================================

Who:	asylumfunk, http://github.com/asylumfunk

What:	XBMC DVD Manager

Where:	A media center near you!

When:	Envisioned on 2009/06/15
	Created on 2009/06/17
	Updated on 2009/06/17

Why:	To put it simply, this is an XBMC script that will allow you to browse your DVD collection through XBMC, without having it on a directly accessible hard drive or network share. Of course, you can't actually watch the video without first inserting the disc, but XBMC will display an entry for it. This will allow you to see it in the list with the rest of your videos, view IMDB information and all of the other benefits that XBMC normally provides.  Attempting to play the video will display a short "Please insert the disc." video.

	The XBMC DVD Manager is a more than just software... it's a solution.

	Since most of my large video collection lives in DVD booklets on a shelf and NOT on a harddrive or network share, keeping track of it all can be a pain. I've got enough to wrap my head around in life, so the last thing I need is to worry about what movies I actually own and whether or not they're
	directly accessible by XBMC.

	I had recently started taking full advantage of XBMC by installing plugins and scripts that made my XBMC experience both easier and more enjoyable. I figured it would be fulfilling to create an XBMC script of my own, plus it would finally give me an excuse to learn Python.

	Later that night, I wanted to watch a movie, so I engaged in the time-wasting ritual that I do all to often; flipping through all of my pages of DVDs. But this time, the frustration with my problem met head-on with my new lust to create an XBMC script and the solution, this software, revealed itself.

	Immediately and before writing a single line of code or enumerating a feature list, I wrote down the following objective, which I hope will always guide the development of this project:

	"to easily peruse my collection of DVDs via XMBC... without ever leaving my couch"

	The project will begin as bare-bones as possible, but I plan on updating it regularly with a healthy, iterative release cycle. I've already got the first few releases planned out in my head, so it ought to keep my busy.

	Love it? Hate it? Have an idea?
	Let me know at @asylumfunk

	I'm getting long-winded now, so what the hell are you still doing reading this?!
	Go ahead and try it out!!!
